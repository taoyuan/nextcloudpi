DESCRIPTION="Move your database to a new location, like a USB drive"

INFO="Note that non Unix filesystems such as NTFS are not supported
because they do not provide a compatible user/permissions system

You need to use a USB drive that is permanently on and is responsive 
or the database will fail.

** If it ever fails with a white page, move the database back to the SD **"
