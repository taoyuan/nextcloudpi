## BUILDING

## PACKING

## TESTING

launch_qemu "$IMGNAME.img" &
sleep 10
wait_SSH "$IP"
sleep 180                         # Wait for the services to start. Improve this ( wait HTTP && trusted domains )
tests/tests.py "$IP" || exit 1

ssh_pi "$IP" sudo halt

## UPLOADING

create_torrent "${IMGNAME}.tar.bz2"
upload_ftp "$IMGNAME"

## CLEANUP

mkdir -p partial && mv NextCloudPi*.bz2 partial
rm -f *.img
